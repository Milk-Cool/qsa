# qsa
QSA is for QuickShellAccess. This tiny program sets up a server that can be accessed by anyone to execute commands.

## Installation
For this thing to work, you'll need `curl`, `wget` and `python3` installed.
Execute this command:
```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milk-Cool/qsa/main/main.sh | sh
```

## Usage
You can set the working directory and the command you want to execute. When you're done, click the **"Submit"** button, wait a little bit and you'll see the output.
